# MR_Spectroscopy
Data from a longitudinal HIV study in Thailand were transferred by secured protocol to myself and Napapon Sailasuta at Huntington Medical Research Institute. 
I processed and analyzed all the data using the time domain linear combination fitting software, LCModel.  
Time domain MRS data from each coil of the 8-channel phased array head coil were combined using unsurpressed water FIDs from each coil as scaling factor. 
The FIDs were processed without spectral line broadening for fitting.  
Fittings were performed between 4.0-0.5 ppm, using a refrence basis set acquired using the same data acquistion parameters as in vivo.
The refrence solutions were 50mM NAA, 50mM CHO, 100mM GLU, 100mM GLN, 100mM CR, and 150mM MI.  All were adjusted to pH 7.2 w/ 0.1M NaOH.  Metabolite qunatifications were included only if the signal to nosie ratio was >4 and STD was <20%.
